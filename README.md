# Iris Species

# Overview
The Iris Species dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. 
It contains measurements of iris flowers from three different species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. 

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains a total of 150 samples of the three species of iris flowers. 

### columns and their details:

1. Id - A unique value
2. Sepal Length (cm) - length of the sepal in centimetre
3. Sepal Width (cm) - width of the sepal in centimetre
4. Petal Length (cm) - length of the petal in centimetre
5. Petal Width (cm) - width of the petal in centimetre
6. Species: The species of the iris flower, which can be one of the following:
   Iris setosa
   Iris versicolor
   Iris virginica

## Learning outcomes

From this dataset, I learned that it is suitable for supervised learning because it has a clear target column, which is Species. 
The target column is categorical, with values indicating different species.
